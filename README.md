# VeterinaryManagementSystem
A fully-working veterinary management system which is written in Java.
* MySQL was used to process the data.

* Maven was used for an easier usage.

It's based on a statement of work, developed first its own database and then application. Its database has enough good mock data.

*-When we start the program, the user selection screen welcomes us. In this screen we have two options. First one is viewing the database as Veterinarian and the second, option is to view the database as Customer.
